Description: We provide a toolbox to conduct a meta analysis for estimating the current expansion rate of the Universe, called the Hubble constant H0, via time delay cosmography. The input data are (i) estimates of Fermat potential differences and their one-sigma uncertainties (standard errors), and (ii) estimates of time delays and their one-sigma uncertainties. Given these inputs, the meta analysis conducts a maximum likelihood estimation or a Bayesian inference to infer the Hubble constant.
